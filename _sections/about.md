The Mathematics of Data Science Seminar Series is hosted by [DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk) at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://dtu.dk) and is organized by [Martin S. Andersen](https://people.compute.dtu.dk/mskan/), [Allan P. Engsig-Karup](https://people.compute.dtu.dk/apek/), and [Jakob Lemvig](http://www2.mat.dtu.dk/people/J.Lemvig). The seminars are open to everyone and aims to bring together researchers, students, and industry practitioners with an interest in mathematics and data science. With this activity, we wish to promote the exchange of ideas, foster cross-disciplinary and interorganizational collaboration, and create a nourishing academic environment for emerging data scientist. Each seminar will be given by an invited speaker from academia or industry and is intended for a broad audience. Topics of interest include:

- mathematical, statistical, and computational methods for data science,
- application areas (e.g., solution of a practical data science problem), and
- current problems and open challenges. 

The seminar series is supported by the [Danish Data Science Academy](https://ddsa.dk).
