#### Title: Intelligent Physics-Driven Technologies for Inverse Problems in MRI

Date: August 15, 2024    
Time: 12:00-12:50    
Location: Building 303A Aud. 44, [DTU Lyngby Campus](https://www.dtu.dk/english/about/campuses/dtu-lyngby-campus), [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/3y2yCAkG5wcdJFcc6)

#### Abstract

Lengthy data acquisition remains a major bottleneck in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), often necessitating tradeoffs in resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, reconstruction and acquisition techniques for rapid imaging, noise reduction and improved data acquisition have received great interest. Each of these directions correspond to a specific inverse problem with its own distinct forward operator dictated by the underlying imaging physics.

In this talk, we will describe recent advances that link these inverse problems in MRI through the lens of intelligent physics-driven technologies. We will first focus on physics-driven deep learning (DL) methods for accelerated MRI. In this context, we will overview our pioneering work on self-supervised learning strategies for training such reconstruction algorithms when ground-truth data is not available, which is a common problem in MRI. We will also show how these can be extended to a subject-specific zero-shot setting when a training database cannot be curated. We will then explore state-of-the-art methods for denoising MRI series that utilize random matrix theory based approaches. We will discuss how this strategy can be combined with physics-driven DL reconstruction to provide a synergistic improvement. Finally, we will overview emerging developments for improving radiofrequency pulse design with a focus on improving field inhomogeneity at ultrahigh field strengths.

### Desmond Higham (University of Edinburgh)

#### Title: When AI goes Awry

Date: August 21, 2024    
Time: 12:00-12:50

#### Abstract

Over the last decade, adversarial attack algorithms have revealed instabilities in deep learning tools. These algorithms raise issues regarding safety, reliability and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI); especially in high risk settings.  At the heart of this landscape are ideas from optimization, numerical analysis and high dimensional stochastic analysis playing key roles. From a practical perspective, there has been a war of escalation between those developing attack and defence strategies. At a more theoretical level, researchers have also studied bigger picture questions concerning the existence and computability of successful attacks. I will present examples of attack algorithms in image classification, optical character recognition and Large Language Models. I will also outline recent results on the overarching question of whether, under reasonable assumptions, it is inevitable that AI tools will be vulnerable to attack.
