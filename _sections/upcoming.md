#### Abstract

We provide the state of the art of Reduced Order Methods (ROM) for parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), and we focus on some perspectives in their current trends and developments, with a special interest in parametric problems arising in offline-online Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Efficient parametrisations (random inputs, geometry, physics) are very important to be able to properly address an offline-online decoupling of the computational procedures and to allow competitive computational performances. Current ROM developments in CFD include: (i) a better use of stable high fidelity methods, to enhance the quality of the reduced model too, and allowing to incorporate turbulence models and increasing the Reynolds number; (ii) more efficient sampling techniques to reduce the number of the basis functions, retained as snapshots, as well as the dimension of online systems; (iii) the improvements of the certification of accuracy based on residual based error bounds and of the stability factors, as well as the guarantee of the stability of the approximation with proper space enrichments.  All the previous aspects are quite relevant in CFD problems to focus on real time simulations for complex parametric industrial, environmental and biomedical flow problems, or even in a control flow setting with data assimilation and uncertainty quantification. Model flow problems will focus on few benchmarks, as well as on simple fluid-structure interaction problems and shape optimisation applied to some industrial problems of interest.
