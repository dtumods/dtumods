In the talk, I will give an overview of the Stochastic morphometry project and how we in the Center for Computational Evolutionary Morphometry aim to build statistical models for morphological evolution and connected phylogenetic inference tools. I will particularly focus on sampling of conditioned stochastic shape processes, both bridges where the process is conditioned on one observation at a fixed time, and processes on a phylogenetic tree conditioned on observations of all leaves. These sampling techniques constitute the foundation of the MCMC schemes we use for inferring parameters of the morphological evolution from data.
