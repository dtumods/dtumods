Estimating the latent state of a dynamical system based on 
noisy observations is a common challenge underlying many tasks in 
engineering, robotics, or weather modeling. We will discuss two 
perspectives of state estimation: temporal inference and spatial 
inference. In this talk, I will provide a machine learning perspective 
on state estimation and discuss what role message passing can play when 
solving large-scale spatio-temporal inference problems as they appear in 
data assimilation.
