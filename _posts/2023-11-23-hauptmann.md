In recent years, deep learning has achieved remarkable empirical success for image reconstruction. This has catalysed an ongoing quest for the precise characterization of the correctness and reliability of data-driven methods in critical use cases, for instance, in medical imaging. Notwithstanding the excellent performance and efficacy of deep learning-based methods, concerns have been raised regarding the approachesâ€™ stability, or lack thereof, with serious practical implications. Significant advances have been made in recent years to unravel the inner workings of data-driven image recovery methods, challenging their widely perceived black-box nature. 

In this talk, I will give an overview of common learned model-based approach in inverse problems. We will discuss relevant notions of robustness and convergence for inverse problems and give examples of models that fall in each category. Specifically, I will challenge the view that learned reconstructions are pure black-box approaches and, in fact, relevant guarantees can also be given in the data-driven world.
