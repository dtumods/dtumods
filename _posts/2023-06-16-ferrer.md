We present the latest developments of our High-Order Spectral Element Solver (HORSES3D), an open source high-order discontinuous Galerkin framework capable of solving a variety of flow applications, including compressible flows (with or without shocks), incompressible flows, various RANS and LES turbulence models, particle dynamics, multiphase flows, and aeroacoustics [1]. 
Recent developments allow us to simulate challenging multiphysics including turbulent flows, multiphase and moving bodies, using local h/p-adaptation and multigrid time advancement. In addition, we present recent work that couples Machine Learning techniques and high-order simulations.
