### Marc Deisenroth (University College London)

#### Title: A Role for Message Passing in Data Assimilation?

Date: November 14, 2023   
Time: 12:00-12:50   
Location: Building 303A Aud. 43, [DTU Lyngby Campus](https://www.dtu.dk/english/about/campuses/dtu-lyngby-campus), [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/3y2yCAkG5wcdJFcc6)

#### Abstract

Estimating the latent state of a dynamical system based on 
noisy observations is a common challenge underlying many tasks in 
engineering, robotics, or weather modeling. We will discuss two 
perspectives of state estimation: temporal inference and spatial 
inference. In this talk, I will provide a machine learning perspective 
on state estimation and discuss what role message passing can play when 
solving large-scale spatio-temporal inference problems as they appear in 
data assimilation.

#### Title: Learned model-based reconstructions for inverse problems: robustness and convergence guarantees

Date: November 23, 2023   
Time: 12:00-12:50   
Location: Building 303A Aud. 43, [DTU Lyngby Campus](https://www.dtu.dk/english/about/campuses/dtu-lyngby-campus), [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/3y2yCAkG5wcdJFcc6)

#### Abstract

In recent years, deep learning has achieved remarkable empirical success for image reconstruction. This has catalysed an ongoing quest for the precise characterization of the correctness and reliability of data-driven methods in critical use cases, for instance, in medical imaging. Notwithstanding the excellent performance and efficacy of deep learning-based methods, concerns have been raised regarding the approachesâ€™ stability, or lack thereof, with serious practical implications. Significant advances have been made in recent years to unravel the inner workings of data-driven image recovery methods, challenging their widely perceived black-box nature. 

In this talk, I will give an overview of common learned model-based approach in inverse problems. We will discuss relevant notions of robustness and convergence for inverse problems and give examples of models that fall in each category. Specifically, I will challenge the view that learned reconstructions are pure black-box approaches and, in fact, relevant guarantees can also be given in the data-driven world.
