### Marc Deisenroth (University College London)

#### Title: A Role for Message Passing in Data Assimilation?

Date: November 14, 2023   
Time: 12:00-12:50   
Location: Building 303A Aud. 43, [DTU Lyngby Campus](https://www.dtu.dk/english/about/campuses/dtu-lyngby-campus), [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/3y2yCAkG5wcdJFcc6)

#### Abstract

Estimating the latent state of a dynamical system based on 
noisy observations is common challenge underlying many tasks in 
engineering, robotics, or weather modeling. We will discuss two 
perspectives of state estimation: temporal inference and spatial 
inference. In this talk, I will provide a machine learning perspective 
on state estimation and discuss what role message passing can play when 
solving large-scale spatio-temporal inference problems as they appear in 
data assimilation.
