### Jan S. Hesthaven (EPFL)

#### Title: Enabling digital twins through modeling, data, and learning — a few examples


Date: May 17, 2024    
Time: 9:00-10:00    
Location: TBA    
Stream: [Zoom](https://dtumods.github.io/zoom)   

#### Abstract

The ability to build efficient physics-based surrogate models with predictive accuracy is an old dream, in particular for complex engineering systems. However, realizing this remains a challenge due to the need to combine advanced computational modeling, reduced complexity models and external data for calibration, updating and uncertainty management. Nevertheless, the perspectives of using such models, often referred to as digital twins, for design, predictive maintenance, operational optimization, and risk analysis are substantial and the potential for impact significant, from safety, planning, and financial points of view. 
In this talk we shall first discuss the importance of efficient and accurate reduced models as a key element in the development of such models for complex systems. This provides a path to generate data which can subsequently be combined with various modern learning techniques to arrive at physics-based models with predictive value and, ultimately, provide decision support.
We shall illustrate this through a number of examples which combine computational first principle models with reduced order models and data driven technologies, e.g., classifiers, Gaussian regression and neural networks, to enable failure analysis, optimal sensor placement, closures for the accurate simulation of drone dynamics and, time permitting, multi-fidelity methods and risk analysis for rare events. 
These are all elements of the workflow that needs to be realized to address the challenge of building predictive surrogate models –Digitial Twins – for complex applications.



### Mehmet Akçakaya (University of Minnesota)

#### Title: Intelligent Physics-Driven Technologies for Inverse Problems in MRI

Date: August 15, 2024    
Time: 12:00-12:50    
Location: TBA    
Stream: [Zoom](https://dtumods.github.io/zoom)   

#### Abstract

 Lengthy data acquisition remains a major bottleneck in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), often necessitating tradeoffs in resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, reconstruction and acquisition techniques for rapid imaging, noise reduction and improved data acquisition have received great interest. Each of these directions correspond to a specific inverse problem with its own distinct forward operator dictated by the underlying imaging physics.

In this talk, we will describe recent advances that link these inverse problems in MRI through the lens of intelligent physics-driven technologies. We will first focus on physics-driven deep learning (DL) methods for accelerated MRI. In this context, we will overview our pioneering work on self-supervised learning strategies for training such reconstruction algorithms when ground-truth data is not available, which is a common problem in MRI. We will also show how these can be extended to a subject-specific zero-shot setting when a training database cannot be curated. We will then explore state-of-the-art methods for denoising MRI series that utilize random matrix theory based approaches. We will discuss how this strategy can be combined with physics-driven DL reconstruction to provide a synergistic improvement. Finally, we will overview emerging developments for improving radiofrequency pulse design with a focus on improving field inhomogeneity at ultrahigh field strengths.
